Description: Represents metagenomic samples on the Euclidean space to examine similarity amongst samples by studying clusters in the model. Given the matrix of metagenomic counts for samples, this package (1) quantifies dissimilarity between samples using Kendall's tau-distance, (2) constructs multidimensional models of different dimension, and (3) plots the models for visualization and comparison.
